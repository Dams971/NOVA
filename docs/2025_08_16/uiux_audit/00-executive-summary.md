# NOVA RDV - UX/UI Audit Executive Summary

## Critical Issues Overview

Based on comprehensive analysis of the NOVA RDV medical appointment booking platform, several critical UX/UI issues have been identified that undermine user trust and medical credibility:

### ðŸš¨ High Priority Issues

1. **Color System Inconsistency**

2. **CTA Hierarchy Problems**
   - "Prendre RDV" button too small for primary action
   - Competing visual elements dilute call-to-action
   - Inconsistent button sizing and spacing

3. **Visual Cohesion Breakdown**
   - Heterogeneous shadow depths (xs, sm, base, lg, medical-card)
   - Inconsistent border radii (medical-small vs lg vs xl)
   - Amateur appearance due to mixed design patterns
