# Component Priority Matrix - NOVA RDV Medical Design System

## Executive Summary

This priority matrix systematically evaluates all components in the NOVA medical design system based on four critical dimensions: Impact, Effort, Dependencies, and Medical Criticality. The matrix guides development sequencing to maximize value delivery while minimizing risk and ensuring medical compliance.

## Evaluation Methodology

### Scoring Dimensions

#### 1. Impact (1-5)
Measures user-facing importance and business value
- **5**: Critical user journey components (Emergency buttons, Primary CTAs)
- **4**: High-value features (Appointment booking, Patient forms)
- **3**: Important but not critical (Navigation, Search)
- **2**: Supporting components (Cards, Labels)
- **1**: Nice-to-have enhancements (Animations, Decorative elements)

#### 2. Effort (1-5)
Estimates development complexity and time required
- **5**: Highly complex (Calendar widget, Complex forms)
- **4**: Moderately complex (Data tables, Multi-step wizards)
- **3**: Standard complexity (Form fields, Modals)
- **2**: Simple components (Buttons, Inputs)
- **1**: Trivial components (Typography, Icons)

#### 3. Dependencies (1-5)
Identifies blocking relationships with other components
- **5**: Blocks many components (Design tokens, Theme system)
- **4**: Blocks several components (Base atoms like Button, Input)
- **3**: Blocks some components (Molecules like FormField)
- **2**: Minimal blocking (Specific organisms)
- **1**: No blocking dependencies (Independent features)

#### 4. Medical Criticality (1-5)
Evaluates importance for healthcare delivery and compliance
- **5**: Life-critical features (Emergency access, Urgent booking)
- **4**: Essential medical functions (Appointment management, Patient data)
- **3**: Important healthcare features (Medical forms, Status indicators)
- **2**: Supporting medical workflow (Navigation, Search)
- **1**: General platform features (Marketing, General UI)

### Priority Score Calculation
```
Priority Score = (Impact × 0.3) + (Dependencies × 0.3) + (Medical Criticality × 0.25) + (Effort × -0.15)
```
*Note: Effort has negative weight as lower effort increases priority*
