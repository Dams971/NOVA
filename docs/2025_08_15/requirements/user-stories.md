## Story: CRITICAL-001 - Fix Blocking TypeScript Error

**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** the TypeScript build to complete without errors  
**So that** I can deploy the NOVA RDV application to production and serve patients booking dental appointments

### Acceptance Criteria (EARS format):

- **WHEN** running `npm run build` **THEN** the command completes successfully without TypeScript errors
- **WHEN** the appointment creation API handles errors **THEN** error messages are safely extracted from unknown types
- **IF** a database error occurs during appointment creation **THEN** the appropriate HTTP status code (409/422/500) is returned
- **FOR** the `/api/appointments/create` endpoint **VERIFY** that error responses maintain the existing JSON structure
- **WHEN** an error object has a message property **THEN** it is safely accessed without type errors
- **IF** an error object doesn't have a message property **THEN** a fallback string representation is used

### Technical Notes:
- Implement `getErrorMessage` utility function for safe error handling
- Apply proper type narrowing for unknown types in catch blocks
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API clients
- Preserve French language error messages for end users

**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: Critical (P0)
