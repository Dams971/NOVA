# Project Brief - NOVA RDV Build & ESLint Issues Resolution

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: NOVA RDV Build Stabilization & Code Quality Enhancement  
**Project Type**: Technical Debt Resolution / Code Quality Initiative  
**Duration**: 5-6 days (Estimated)  
**Team Size**: 1-2 developers (recommended)  
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Blocking deployment)

## Executive Summary

The NOVA RDV dental appointment booking platform currently has critical build failures and extensive code quality issues preventing reliable deployment and maintenance. This project will systematically resolve a blocking TypeScript error and over 1000 ESLint warnings to restore build stability and establish maintainable code standards.

---

## Problem Statement

### Critical Business Impact
The NOVA RDV platform, serving dental patients in Algeria, cannot be deployed to production due to:
- **Blocking Build Error**: TypeScript compilation failure in appointment creation endpoint
- **Code Quality Crisis**: 1000+ ESLint warnings indicating systematic quality issues
- **Deployment Risk**: Unreliable builds preventing confident deployment to serve patients
- **Developer Productivity**: Quality warnings obscuring real issues during development

### Technical Root Causes
1. **TypeScript 4.4+ Compatibility**: Unknown error types in catch blocks require proper type narrowing
2. **Legacy Code Patterns**: Inconsistent use of modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
3. **React Hooks Compliance**: Missing dependencies causing potential runtime issues
4. **Inconsistent Standards**: Mixed coding patterns across the codebase

---

## Proposed Solution

## Technical Strategy

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Error Handling**: Implement reusable `getErrorMessage` utility for safe error processing
2. **Type System**: Use `unknown` with type guards instead of `any` types
3. **React Patterns**: Ensure all hooks follow exhaustive dependencies rule
4. **Import Strategy**: Modernize to ES6 imports while respecting Next.js patterns

### Implementation Principles
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, testable changes with continuous validation
- **Automation First**: Rely on ESLint and TypeScript for quality enforcement
- **Documentation**: Clear patterns for future development

### Technology Stack Constraints
- **Next.js 15.3.5**: App Router patterns required
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Strict mode must remain enabled
- **React 19.x**: Modern hooks patterns and compliance
- **ESLint 9.x**: Flat configuration with strict rules
