# Comparative Analytics Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

The Comparative Analytics Dashboard has been successfully implemented as part of task 4.3. This dashboard provides comprehensive multi-cabinet comparison capabilities with advanced analytics features.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Cabinet Comparison Views with Charts
- **Interactive Cabinet Selection**: Toggle visibility of individual cabinets
- **Real-time Comparison Charts**: Line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots
- **Multiple Metrics Support**: Revenue, appointments, utilization, satisfaction
- **Time Series Visualization**: Compare trends across different time periods

### 2. Performance Benchmarking Tools
- **Network Benchmarks**: Top performer, network average, and bottom performer
- **Visual Benchmarking**: Bar charts with reference lines for network averages
- **Statistical Analysis**: Percentiles, standard deviation, and outlier detection
- **Cabinet Ranking**: Automatic identification of best and worst performers

### 3. Trend Analysis and Anomaly Detection
- **Trend Correlation**: Scatter plots showing relationships between metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of unusual patterns
- **Severity Classification**: Low, medium, and high severity anomalies
- **Statistical Outlier Detection**: IQR and Z-score methods
- **Performance Alerts**: Automatic flagging of underperforming cabinets

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: 20 tests for analytics service methods
- **Component Tests**: 12 tests for dashboard functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 5 tests for admin dashboard integration
- **Statistical Functions**: Tested calculation accuracy and edge cases

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `ComparativeAnalyticsDashboard.tsx`: Main dashboard component
- `AdminDashboard.tsx`: Integration with existing admin interface

### Services
- Extended `AnalyticsService` with comparative methods:
  - `getComparativeAnalytics()`
  - `getBenchmarkData()`
  - `detectAnomalies()`
  - `calculateStatistics()`
  - `detectOutliers()`

### Models
- Added new interfaces to `analytics.ts`:
  - `BenchmarkData`
  - `AnomalyDetection`
  - `ComparativeAnalytics`

### Key Features

#### Dashboard Views
1. **Overview**: Network summary with multi-cabinet charts
2. **Trends**: Performance trend analysis and correlations
3. **Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarking against network averages
4. **Anomalies**: Automated anomaly detection and alerts

#### Interactive Features
- Cabinet visibility toggling
- Date range selection (7d, 30d, 90d, custom)
- Metric selection for comparisons
- Real-time data updates
- Export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV)

#### Statistical Analysis
- Mean, median, standard deviation calculations
- Percentile analysis (25th, 75th, 90th, 95th)
- Outlier detection using IQR and Z-score methods
- Trend calculation with percentage changes
- Correlation analysis between metrics

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Multi-cabinet comparison views with charts
